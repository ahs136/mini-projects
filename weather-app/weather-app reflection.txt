To build this weather app, I started by setting up a clean and minimal HTML structure with semantic elements and unique IDs for easy JavaScript targeting. The goal was to focus primarily on practicing JavaScript concepts, so I used AI to quickly generate a functional CSS stylesheet. This let me save time on styling and prioritize learning dynamic DOM manipulation and API handling.


I began scripting with script.js, where I practiced calling the OpenWeather API, parsing the response, and logging the data to understand its structure. This gave me hands-on experience with fetch(), working with JSON, and handling errors from API responses.


Once the data fetch was working, I shifted to dynamic.js, where I implemented DOM creation logic to dynamically generate weather cards for each city entered. Each card includes the city name, temperature, weather description, and a delete button. I used append() to insert multiple elements efficiently, and added event listeners to handle removal of cards. This step took some trial and error with creating document elements such as headers and paragraphs, since previously i would simply edit the innertext of an existing div.


To ensure a better user experience, I also implemented duplicate detection logic, preventing users from searching the same city multiple times. Along the way, I learned to clear the search bar after each valid search and improved the visual layout with responsive CSS cards and interactive delete buttons.


This project deepened my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals like event handling, DOM manipulation, API requests, and dynamic UI updates.
